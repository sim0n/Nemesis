## Nemesis Anti-Cheat
Nemesis is an open source anti-cheat with a main purpose of elevating Minecraft anti-cheat development by providing a good system along with good methods that make sense.

### Features
* Flexible check system
* Flexible Command system
* Easy to use configuration system
* Database / logging system
* File system to download libraries and inject them into the classloader instead of shading into the jar
* Fast packet system that doesn't use reflection
* Advanced tracking system
* Flexible violation system
* A good amount of util to make your life a lot easier

### Notes
Nemesis already contains quite a few checks to get you started, they're not perfect, but they're good enough.

#### Compiling
As there is no public repo (that I'm aware of) that hosts CraftBukkit you'll have to build it yourself with [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#1-8-8). After this simply use the default goal 
```xml
mvn package
```

### Usage
If you use this base and sell it or take anything from it all I ask for is credit.
